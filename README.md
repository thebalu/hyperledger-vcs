# Commit contract

This project is a fork of the `fabric-samples` provided by Hyperledger, licensed under Apache 2.0. 

We have removed most of the examples and used the `commercial_paper` contract as a starting point to develop our demo project.
It is a smart contract that allows the version control of a file. Organizations can propose commits, vote on them and apply them to the content of a file.

We have also made a few changes to the `test-network` configuration and scripts to bring up a suitable network.

We claim no ownership of the rest of the content in this repository.

We also use the [diff-patch-match](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) tool, licensed under Apache 2.0.
